    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Once, a dog ran into a <em>museum full of mirrors.</em> The museum was
      unique, the walls,ceiling,doors,and even<mark>
        floors were made of mirrors.</mark
      >
      Seeing <strong>his reflections, the dogs froze in the middle</strong> of
      the hall surprisingly. But he could see a whole pack of dogs surrounding
      him from all sides, from top to bottom.

    <h2>Angry Man</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The <strong>angry man</strong> <u>jumped out of his car</u> and grabbed
      the closet boy and yelled,
      <em
        >"What was that?what the hell have you done to my car? Why did you do
        that?"</em
      >
      The boy was very scared but extremely polite and apologized."Sorry,Sir.I
      didn't know what else to do," he said.<u
        >"I had to throw bricks because no one else would stop to ask for my
        help."</u
      >
      With tears rolling down his cheeks . He pointed to the parked cars and
      said
      <strong
        >"this is my brother, he rolled forward and fell from the wheelchair
        ,and he is seriously injuried,I cannot lift him."</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
    <p>
      The crying boy asked the man,<strong
        >"Could you help me get him back in his wheelchair?</strong
      >
      He is injuried and too heavy for me."he quickly lifted the other boy from
      the p0lace and put him back in the wheelchair. He also helped the boy with
      his bruises and cuts.
      <br />
      When he though everything would be fine, he went back to his car,<strong
        >"Thank you,</strong
      >
      sir, and <strong>God bless you,</strong>"said the grateful boy.<em
        >The young man</em
      >
      was too shocked for any word.When he got out of the car, he looked at the
      building door of his car. the damage was very noticeable,but he didn't
      bother to repair it. He held the money to remind him of the message;<b>
        "Dont't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you
        to get your attention."</b
