    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Once, a dog ran into a <em>museum full of mirrors.</em> The museum was
      unique, the walls,ceiling,doors,and even<mark>
        floors were made of mirrors.</mark>
      Seeing <strong>his reflections, the dogs froze in the middle</strong> of
      the hall surprisingly. But he could see a whole pack of dogs surrounding
      him from all sides, from top to bottom.

    <h2>Angry Man</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>The angry man jumped out of his car and grabbed the closet boy and yelled,
       "What was that?what the hell have you done to my car? Why did you do that?" 
       The boy was very scared but extremely polite and apologized."Sorry,Sir.I 
       didn't kmow what else to do," he said. "I had to throw bricks because no one
       else would stop to ask for my help." With tears rolling down his cheeks . He 
       pointed to the parked cars and said "this is my brother, he rolled forward and 
       fell from the wheelchair ,and he is seriously injuried,I cannot lift him."</p> 
<h3>And then</h3>
<p>The crying boy asked the man,"Couyld you help me get him back in his wheelchair? He is injuried and too heavy for me."he quickly liftedthe other boy from the p0lace and put him back in the wheelchair. He also helped the boy with his bruisesand cuts.
    <br></br>
    When he thougth everything would be fine, he went back to his car,"Thank you, sir, and God bless you,"said the grateful boy. The young man was too schoked for any word.
