        Once, a dog ran into a <em>museum full of mirrors.</em>
        The museum was unique, the walls,ceiling,doors,and even
        <mark>floors were made of mirrors.</mark>Seeing<strong>
          his reflections, the dogs froze in the middle
        </strong>
        of the hall surprisingly. <br />But he could see a whole pack of dogs
        surrounding him from all sides, from top to bottom.

        The <strong>angry man</strong> <u>jumped out of his car</u> and grabbed
        the closet boy and yelled,
        <em
          >"What was that?what the hell have you done to my car? Why did you do
          that?"</em
        >
        The boy was very scared but extremely polite and apologized."Sorry,Sir.I
        didn't know what else to do," he said.<u
          >"I had to throw bricks because no one else would stop to ask for my
          help."</u
        >
        With tears rolling down his cheeks . He pointed to the parked cars and
        said<br />
        <strong
          >"this is my brother, he rolled forward and fell from the wheelchair
          ,and he is seriously injuried,I cannot lift him."</strong

        The crying boy asked the man,<strong
          >"Could you help me get him back in his wheelchair?</strong
        >
        He is injuried and too heavy for me."he quickly lifted the other boy
        from the p0lace and put him back in the wheelchair. He<br />
        also helped the boy with his bruises and cuts.
        <br />
        When he though everything would be fine, he went back to his car,<strong
          >"Thank you,</strong

        sir, and <strong>God bless you,</strong>"said the grateful boy.<em
          >The young man</em
        >
        was too shocked for any word.When he got out of the car, he looked
        <br />at the building door of his car. the damage was very
        noticeable,but he didn't bother to repair it. He held the money to
        remind him of the message;<b>
          "Dont't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick<br />
          at you to get your attention."</b
