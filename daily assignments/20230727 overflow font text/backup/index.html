            Churachandpur where the Kuki community had protested against a
            proposal to grant scheduled tribe status to the dominant Meitei
            community. More than 160 people have lost their lives, and several
            have been injured since ethnic violence broke out in the state on
            May 3, when a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organized in the hill
            districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for
            Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
